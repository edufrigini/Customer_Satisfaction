# Customer_Satisfaction
Predicting the Level of Customer Satisfaction of Santander
Customer satisfaction is a key measure of success. Customers dissatisfied customers cancel their services and rarely express their dissatisfaction before to leave. Satisfied customers, on the other hand, become brand advocates!
Banco Santander is asking you to help them identify dissatisfied at the beginning of the relationship. This would allow Santander to
take proactive steps to improve a client's happiness before it's too late.
In this machine learning project, you will work with hundreds anonymous resources to predict whether a customer is satisfied or dissatisfied with your banking experience.
Clearly define the business problem, collect and prepare the data, choose an algorithm, train the model and evaluate the accuracy, which must be at least 70%.
For this project, I used Python language and the dataset available on Kaggle at:
